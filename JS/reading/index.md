# You did it! Welcome to the Course!

## What do I do?

The main idea of this course is to complete the challenges for each of 4 modules. As was previously mentioned, if you are able to complete at least eighty percent of the challenges, you will unlock features not available to anyone who has not completed this task; giving yourself the best possible chance at getting into the Immersive program. 

We have seen tremendous success over the last year with students who complete large portions of the course and it is our pleasure to offer this preparatory tool for free. We want to help you get there! Sign into Slack to say hello to the Staff - Send an email to david.coleman@hackreactor.com with the subject, "Cut Me Some Slack" if you need assistance joining our Slack team
