# JavaScript Overview

## Key Takeaways

In this section, you will:
* Learn the history of JavaScript
* Learn how to use the JavaScript console
* Write your first line of JavaScript code
* Think through your first algorithm... ooh scary sounding word ðŸ˜¨ ðŸ™ˆ ðŸ˜¨

<div class='alert alert-info'><strong>Note</strong><br>If you already feel comfortable with the topics above, scroll to the bottom of this page and try the "Check For Understanding" questions. If they seem easy, answer them and move on to the next lesson!</div>

## Explanation #1

For much of the Building Blocks Intro section, we will be leaning on Udacity's Intro to JavaScript course. [Head over to their site](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-javascript--ud803) and create an account.

Once you do that, complete the first section of the course.

## Explanation #2

Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y62zj9ozPOM), stopping at 31:16*

\*Note 1 -- the lecturer is somewhat of a fast talker -- you may find the speed adjusting feature in YouTube useful. Simply click the âš™ -> select speed -> and adjust to whatever pace you're comfortable with.

\*Note 2 -- you can finish the video if you like. They go into some problem solving using a drag-and-drop programming language called Scratch. If you consider yourself a visual learner (or if you don't but want to explore a different approach), finishing the video and also working on some problems that are part of their [Hour of Code](https://studio.code.org/hoc/1) project is a good use of time. The content may seem kid-focused, because... well... it is, but good introductory content is age agnostic and the visual aspect really helps form a strong mental model. You can find more advanced lessons [here](https://studio.code.org/s/express) -- if you can get through Lesson 8 (Nested Loops in Frozen) you've basically covered all the concepts through the Building Blocks _Mastery_ section, so don't expect to blaze through all those problems without some amount of struggle.

\*Note 3 -- [Lightbot](http://lightbot.com/hour-of-code.html) is another great visual game and they have a longer, [paid version](http://lightbot.com/) if you find it helpful, plus it's on iPhone and Android.
