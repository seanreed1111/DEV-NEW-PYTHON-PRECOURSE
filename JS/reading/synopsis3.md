# Live Performance

The axe is sharp and you have figured out how to swing it consistently...

Time for the razzle and the dazzle. 

## Overview

### Live-coding with an audience is its own set of skills

Admissions interviews are, in effect, **live performances**.  So are the real job interviews that you will encounter later.

In general, code pairing -- i.e., where you code in real-time with a coding partner -- is also a species of "live performance".

Effective live-coding with another person is a very useful skill to have throughout your career. Let's start honing that skill now! 

This is similar to any kind of solo rehearsal or practice -- stand-up comedians practice their material in front of a mirror, tennis players rally against a practice wall, parliamentary debaters practice preparing and delivering their statements while timing themselves.


## The Goal

You will practice and demonstrate your ability to understand, plan, and cleanly implement a coding problem under the twin pressures of limited time and the knowledge that you are recording yourself. 

## What to do


The motivating theme behind the Live Performance module is that you can get a lot of benefit from **recording videos** and **assessing your own performance** first, i.e., before you even ask anyone else to watch you perform.

You know how your voice sounds "funny" to you when you hear a recording of it?  Well, watching and listening to a screencast of yourself attempting to solve a coding problem can be **pretty eye-opening**!  You will see all kinds of obvious ways to improve the way you are solving the problem and the way you are coming across to the audience as you do so.

## FAQ

### How do I record a screencast with audio?

On a Mac, we suggest using the built-in Quicktime Player. Make sure to TURN ON AUDIO, like this:
