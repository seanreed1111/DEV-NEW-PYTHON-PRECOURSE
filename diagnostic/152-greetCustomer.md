### !question

Write a function called "greetCustomers".

Given a name string and a customerData dictionary, "greetCustomers" returns a greeting string based on how many times that customer has visited the restaurant.  Please refer to the following sample customerData dictionary.

Suppose the customer data is given by:

customerData = {'Joe': {'visits': 1},
  'Carol': {'visits': 2},
  'Howard': {'visits': 3},
  'Carrie': {'visits': 4}}

The greeting should be different, depending on the name on their reservation.

Case 1 - Unknown customer ( Name is not present in customerData ):

```
output = greetCustomer('Terrance', customerData)
print(output) # --> 'Welcome! Is this your first time?'
```

Case 2 - Customer who has visited only once ( 'visits' value is 1 ):

```
output = greetCustomer('Joe', customerData)
print(output) # --> 'Welcome back, Joe! We're glad you liked us the first time!'
```

Case 3 - Repeat customer: ( 'visits' value is greater than 1 ):

```
output = greetCustomer('Carol', customerData)
print(output) # --> 'Welcome back, Carol! So glad to see you again!'
```

Notes:
* Your function should NOT alter the customerData dictionary to update the number of visits.
* Do NOT hardcode to the exact sample data!
Your program will be tested on different sample data!

* You cannot do something like this:
```
if (firstName === 'Joe'):  # do something

```
It won't work , because YOUR FUNCTION MIGHT BE
TESTED ON A CUSTOMER DICTIONARY THAT DOES NOT HAVE 'JOE' in it.
